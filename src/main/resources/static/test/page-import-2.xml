        <body>Technological level of a civilization that is "close to the level presently attained on earth, with energy
            consumption at ≈4×1019 erg/sec" (4×1012 watts).[1] Currently, the civilization of Type I is usually defined
            as one that can harness all the energy that falls on a planet from its parent star (for Earth–Sun system,
            this value is close to 1.74×1017 watts), which is about four orders of magnitude higher than the amount
            presently attained on Earth, with energy consumption at ≈2×1013 watts. The astronomer Guillermo A.
            Lemarchand stated this as a level near contemporary terrestrial civilization with an energy capability
            equivalent to the solar insolation on Earth, between 1016 and 1017 watts.[2]
